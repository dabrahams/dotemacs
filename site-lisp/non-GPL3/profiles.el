;;; Change log:
;;;
;;; version 0.3 - 2009-04-05 Added the customisation variables, and defined
;;; `profile-define' to replace `profile-create' and `profile-replace'.
;;;
;;; version 0.2 - 2009-04-04 `Profiles' is set immediately after the creation of
;;;    the buffer. Previously it was set only after a few step and that caused
;;;    certain packages not to work with `Profiles'.
;;;
;;; version 0.1 - 2009-03-31 - First version

;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Todo:
;;;
;;;
;;; Create function profile-define with both profile-create and profile-replace
;;; functionalities.

;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Description:
;;;
;;; Profiles manages user-defined sets of generic properties such as user name
;;; or mailing address across various buffers. Profiles are aimed towards
;;; developers that work on different projects, sometimes under different names,
;;; different mailing address, and that wish to apply similar settings across
;;; different files.
;;;
;;; `Profiles' provides a higher level functionality that `dirvars.el', albeit
;;; less invasive. Where `dirvars.el' requires you to create a file in each of
;;; your project files, profiles try to take adventage of the fact that each
;;; particular project's setting are probably similar in some way or require
;;; more than just setting user variables. In any case, `profiles' can be used
;;; together with `dirvars.el'.
;;;
;;; For exemple, user Joe is working on project ProjA and ProjB. Both projects
;;; imposes that coding style follows "gnu" standards, but Joe generally prefer
;;; to work with "elemtel" and this is what he is using for all his other
;;; projects. He is also using a different mailing address for both projects,
;;; and wants it to be set automatically for his ChangeLog.Fortunatly, Joe uses
;;; `profiles' and he has configured his "~/.emacs" in this way:
;;;
;;;     (require 'profiles)
;;;     (profile-define "usual" "Joe" "joeuser@usual.com"
;;;                     'coding-style "elemtel"
;;;                     ; any property value can be attached!
;;;                     'prefered-license "GPLv2")
;;;     (profile-define "proj-a-and-b" "Joe" "joeuser@proj-a-and-b.com"
;;;                     'coding-style "gnu"
;;;                     'prefered-license nil)
;;;     (setq profile-path-alist
;;;           '(("/path/to/proj/a" . "proj-a-and-b")
;;;             ("/path/to/proj/b" . "proj-a-and-b")))
;;;     (profile-set-default "usual")
;;;
;;;     ; ...and later in his config file...
;;;     (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
;;;               '(lambda ()
;;;                   (c-set-style (profile-current-get 'coding-style))))
;;;
;;;     ; ...and a little later too...
;;;     (add-hook 'change-log-mode-hook
;;;	          '(lambda ()
;;;                   (setq add-log-full-name
;;;                         (profile-current-name))
;;;                   (setq add-log-mailing-address
;;;                         (profile-current-mailing-address))))
;;;
;;; And voila! His name, mailing address and coding style are now
;;; automatically set for ProjA and ProjB to the desired values. This did not
;;; require Joe to make any amendement to the project themselves. Adding new
;;; profiles will be easy too.
;;;
;;; Saving the profile path in your "~/.emacs" is not such a good idea however.
;;; Instead you can use the interactive function `profile-add-regexp-and-save'
;;; that will populate `profile-path-alist' with a new entry. This setting will
;;; be saved in the file `profile-path-alist-file'.
;;;
;;; You can automatically load the settings of this file by adding:
;;;
;;;     (profile-load-path-alist)
;;;
;;; ...in your "~/.emacs". This file is printed in human readable lisp and can
;;; be edited manually, as necessary.
